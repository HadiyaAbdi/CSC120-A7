- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
it makes my code overall less redundant where i can reuse some of the stuff i alreayd by using inheritance.
i can extend a class without modifying other classes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
what worked: code is less redundant, fexible and i was able to make each subclass extend to Building without any errors. didnt work: selcofee initially was giving me negative values. i kept having an error when i had set up y constuctor, mainly because i was confused and not using super() but was able to solve it. Something that helped while doing this was constant revision of class materials and past examples and i believe that would help other students taking this course in the future aswwell.
